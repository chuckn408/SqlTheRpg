Sql - The RPG : Learn SQL , adventurer!

Sql The RPG is a text-based RPG game that teaches the player how to use SQL due to the sole dependence of using SQL to interact with the game.  Simple in design, easily modifyable- it can be easily played on any terminal with sql installed.  The command line will be on the left window pane while a responsive grapical ASCII still will on the right pane.

User will be able to:
-Create avatar, world
-Navigate and modify their world
-Move, create and transform objects
-Save, Load and Continue game sessions

Possible (much) future features:
-Multiplayer interaction(via sql injections)
-Animated ASCII art
-Screenshot shortcut
